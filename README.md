# ZPLSharp
A wrapper for the ZPL Language, enabling a direct interaction between .NET and ZPL.

## License
ZPL Sharp is free for evaluative or non-commercial use. Reverse engineering is prohibited.


## Description
ZPLSharp allows programming for ZPL printers to be done in an object oriented fashion without using any actual ZPL Code.
Build labels, formats, and format fillers dynamically and send them off to a printer connected via TCP/IP.
Most printer administration commands are also implemented, meaning printers can be remotely administered by .NET.

ZPLSharp is still in development and not all planned features are currently implemented.
