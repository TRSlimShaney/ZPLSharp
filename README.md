# ZPLSharp
A wrapper for the ZPL Language, enabling a direct interaction between .NET and ZPL compatible printers.
Please note that this library is not complete and does not support all ZPL functionality.

## License
ZPLSharp was previously available under a restrictive license, but now has been relicensed under the MIT License as an open-source library.


## Description
ZPLSharp allows programming for ZPL printers to be done in an object oriented fashion without using any actual ZPL Code.
Build labels, formats, and format fillers dynamically and send them off to a printer connected via TCP/IP.
Most printer administration commands are also implemented, meaning printers can be remotely administered by .NET.

ZPLSharp is a .NET Standard 2.0 Library, meaning it is compatible with either the mainline .NET Framework 4.6.1 (or later) or .NET Core 2.x (or later).

ZPLSharp is still in development and not all planned features are currently implemented.
