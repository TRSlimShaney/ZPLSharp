# ZPLSharp
A wrapper for the ZPL Language, enabling a direct interaction between .NET and ZPL compatible printers.

## License
ZPLSharp is free for evaluative or non-commercial use. Evaluative use is clarified as use of the software in an attempt to decide whether or not an entity would like to implement the software BEFORE it is deployed. Non-commercial use is clarified as NOT being used in a for-profit entity, therefore if the entity is for-profit they cannot use this software freely and must purchase a license. Reverse engineering and decompilation are prohibited.


## Description
ZPLSharp allows programming for ZPL printers to be done in an object oriented fashion without using any actual ZPL Code.
Build labels, formats, and format fillers dynamically and send them off to a printer connected via TCP/IP.
Most printer administration commands are also implemented, meaning printers can be remotely administered by .NET.

ZPLSharp is a .NET Standard 2.0 Library, meaning it is compatible with either the mainline .NET Framework 4.6.1 (or later) or .NET Core 2.x (or later).

ZPLSharp is still in development and not all planned features are currently implemented.
